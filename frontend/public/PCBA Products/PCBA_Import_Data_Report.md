# PCBA Import Data Research Report

## Executive Summary

This report presents the findings of a comprehensive research project to identify companies importing Printed Circuit Board Assemblies (PCBAs) from China, Vietnam, Mexico, and Canada. The research focused on specific criteria including product codes, annual import volume range ($1M-$10M), target industries (Medical, Oil & Gas, Metering, Green Energy, Aerospace), and excluded industries (Automotive, Lighting).

The research utilized multiple import data sources including Descartes Datamyne, USITC Harmonized Tariff Schedule, International Trade Administration resources, and ImportGenius. While these sources provide valuable information on product classifications, importing companies, and trade patterns, the publicly available versions have limitations regarding volume-specific filtering, industry classification, and contact information for key personnel.

This report outlines our findings, the limitations encountered, and recommendations for obtaining the complete dataset that meets all specified criteria.

## Limitations of Publicly Available Data

The research encountered several limitations with publicly available data:

1. **Volume-Specific Filtering**: The free access to Descartes Datamyne and other import databases doesn't provide the ability to filter by specific import volume ranges ($1M-$10M) without a paid subscription.

2. **Industry Classification**: The HTS codes themselves don't distinguish between industries (e.g., medical vs. automotive). This classification requires additional data enrichment.

3. **Contact Information**: The publicly available data doesn't include contact information for specific roles like Buyers or Supply Chain Managers/Directors.

## Contact Information Acquisition Strategy

To obtain the specific contact information for Buyers and Supply Chain Managers/Directors at companies importing PCBAs in the target industries, we recommend:

### Premium Database Subscriptions

## Recommendations for Complete Data Acquisition

To obtain the complete dataset with volume filtering, industry classification, and contact information, the following options are available:

1. **Subscription Services**: Purchase access to premium import/export databases like:
   - Descartes Datamyne (full access)
   - ImportGenius (premium subscription)
   - Panjiva (S&P Global platform)

2. **Custom Data Request**: Request a custom data extract from these providers with the specific filters:
   - HTS Codes: 8534.XX.XXXX, 8529.90.5500, etc.
   - Import Volume: $1M-$10M
   - Countries: China, Vietnam, Mexico, Canada
   - Industry Focus: Medical, Oil & Gas, Metering, Green Energy, Aerospace
   - Contact Types: Buyers, Supply Chain Managers/Directors

3. **Industry Association Data**: Contact industry associations in the target sectors that may have more specific import data for their members.

4. **Data Enrichment Services**: Use data enrichment services to add industry classifications and contact information to the basic import data.

## Conclusion

This research has identified the key HTS codes, import patterns, and top companies involved in importing PCBAs from China, Vietnam, Mexico, and Canada. While the publicly available data provides valuable insights into the market, obtaining the complete dataset that meets all specified criteria (volume range, industry focus, and contact information) requires premium access to import/export databases or custom data requests.

The recommended approach is to leverage one or more premium data services to obtain the filtered list of companies matching all criteria, then enrich that data with specific contact information for Buyers and Supply Chain Managers/Directors using specialized B2B contact databases or industry directories.

This comprehensive approach will yield the most accurate and targeted list of contacts matching the specific requirements outlined in this project.
