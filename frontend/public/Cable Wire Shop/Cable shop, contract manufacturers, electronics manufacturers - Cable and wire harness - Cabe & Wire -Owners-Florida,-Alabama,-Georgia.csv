However, the exact number is not listed, and the information fluctuates depending on the source. The LinkedIn estimate is the most relevant available data.","No, Song Chuan Precision Europe GmbH is not privately owned and is part of a publicly traded company, Song Chuan Precision Co., Ltd., which is listed on the Taipei Exchange. This indicates that it is not a privately-owned enterprise. Furthermore, it appears the company has undergone various corporate transformations, which is typical for public companies. Thus, it is also not likely to be owner-operated, as public companies typically have a board of directors and are managed by a team rather than being run solely by the founder or owner.",Founded in 1974 – 50 years old as of 2024.,"I estimate that Sean McCarthy is likely around 55 to 65 years old based on his extensive career background. He has 33 years of experience in the industry which suggests that he may have started his career around 1990. If he graduated from college around that time, he would likely have been born around the mid-1960s. However, concrete birth year data wasn’t directly retrieved from the current searches. Thus, this estimate is made based on typical career progression and the founding year of the company in 1974, suggesting he has significant experience and might be approaching retirement age.","Sean McCarthy, Managing Director and CEO at Song Chuan Precision Europe GmbH.
