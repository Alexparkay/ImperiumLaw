KAINYE'S WATCH GLOBAL CONCEPT,"KAINYE’S WATCH GLOBAL CONCEPT  is a company with fresh ideas. It has a strong pedigree in the
Nigerian security industry and is run by some of the most experienced professionals
in the business. The security firm's key executives have all worked in other security systems c
ompanies
before. So it has a strong and well-proven foundation of knowledge and
practical experience. But when Managing Director  Patrick Essien  established Kainye's Watch Global Concept he
had something distinctively different in mind.
KAINYE’S WATCH GLOBAL CONCEPT provides electronic security installation and servicing, in particul
ar to higher-end corporate accounts. Its product range includes Intruder detection alarm, Fire Alarms,
CCTV, Access Control Systems , CCTV Monitoring and Remote video transmission on Pc and
Mobile devices, Inverter, PABX System, Networking and Personal body protection devices.
KAINTE’S WATCH GLOBAL CONCEPT has a focus on the customer which is exceptional in the indust
ry.
“Many companies will claim they are customer driven, but we know the reality,”. We realized th
at there was still an opening for a company offering superior service, quality products and the
Highest standards of installation.”
KAINYE’S WATCH GLOBAL CONCEPT is unique, in being a “one stop-shop” for all electronic security r
equirements, including fire systems, Access control, Automatic extinguishing systems and in pro
viding the option of a full parts & labor warranty on all systems. We also recognized that prof
essionalism, technical competence and ongoing training are vital to success in a rapidly changi
ng marketplace. We've made sure; therefore, that KAINYE’S WATCH GLOBAL CONCEPT was structure
d from the outset to be a leader in this regard.
All its systems employ leading edge technology and every member of its staff has at least five
years industry experience. In fact, most have significantly more than this. The team is strong
on technical expertise.
Technology already plays an extremely important role in this business and is set to be even m
ore important in the future, Intruder alarms may still be the 'bread & butter' of the business, bu
t Access control systems and CCTV represent important areas of growth and with good reason
. We believe that as technologies improve it allows customers to benefit from ever more sophi
sticated and reliable approaches to security at lower operating costs.
CCTV, for example, has become a standard requirement for more and more businesses seekin
g to comply with Health & Safety requirements, to protect themselves from fraudulent insurance
claims and product “shrinkage” in the western world. Up to a few years ago CCTV recording i
nvolved the use of video tapes which had to be changed manually every 24 hours and require
d laborious archiving. Now, in the modern digital age, recording systems can be installed which
run without manual intervention. It is possible to capture and retain footage for up to 36 mont
hs.
The Internet has made it possible nowadays to monitor all types of systems remotely at except
ionally low cost. Two way communications channels even allow for direct intervention. Remote
monitoring, which can include everything from power supply status and equipment temperatures
to alarms and CCTV cameras, can significantly reduce the costs of security for companies wh
ich have traditionally relied on 24 hour on-site security personnel.
Monitored CCTV can remove a customer's need to have personnel on site. In the event of an
intrusion the monitoring staff can speak directly to the intruder warning him/her that they have
been detected and the Police are on their way. More and more companies are finding that fo
r cost efficiency they really cannot ignore the potential benefits of the latest technologies in the
 security systems.",Security and Investigations,2-10 employees,Privately Held,United States,instagram.com,https://www.linkedin.com/company/kwgconcept,YES,"KAINYE'S WATCH GLOBAL CONCEPT provides electronic security installation, specializing in areas such as CCTV, access control, and fire alarm systems.

They can be mounted on any fixed structure such as shipping containers, light posts, trees, fences and rafters.

We also have portable one camera indoor rigs that can be moved around and placed inside of the structure to protect appliances from thieves and vandals as may be required per your construction managers.
